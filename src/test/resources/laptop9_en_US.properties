 \
Sony is so confident that the VAIO S is a superior \
ultraportable laptop that the company proudly compares the notebook to \
Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro. And in a lot of ways this notebook is \
better, thanks to a lighter weight, higher-resolution display, more \
storage space, and a Blu-ray drive.
